Project: Pong Corona

Group's repository:https://github.com/amanzur16/Final-Project

What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project? I got a new idea of what kind of game to create

In what ways does this game reflect the theme? it has different countries and where the virus started in china, you use china to infect others.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to 
apply to your own future games? I would like to see more games that represent current events, as not many games really do that. It would be exciting.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game? Just upload the missing scenes maybe someone who did them has them and forgot? i would
love to play this game, the description and it all sounds exciting!

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what? nothing was confusing

Is it clear that every group member participated? it is not clear right away, playing the game would help me answer this question better. 
But i can see where work was seperated when editing it in godot

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE? yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more 
descriptive? They could add who did what, a title for their game. ALso some spelling errors could be fixed easily.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game. The game sounds very fun, but due to missing scenes i was unable to play it!
How many of your points would you allocate to this project?2
